To use the notebooks here, create a `conda` environment using *qgraph_env.yml*

Instructions for creating a `conda` environment from a yaml file are located [here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file). This will automatically create an `conda` environment named `qgraph`, which you should use as your Jupyter kernel.
